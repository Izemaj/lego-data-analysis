# LEGO Analysis

This repository contains an analysis of LEGO sets released from 1950 to 2022, using Python and data visualization libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn. The goal of this analysis is to explore the history of LEGO sets, identify trends and patterns in the data, and answer questions such as:

- What are the most popular LEGO themes?
- How has the size and complexity of LEGO sets changed over time?
- When did LEGO really expand its product offering, and how did it affect the company's strategy?

The dataset used for this analysis was obtained from the Rebrickable API, which provides detailed information about each LEGO set, including the number of parts, release year, theme, and more.

## Data Cleaning and Preparation

The raw data obtained from the API was cleaned and transformed using Python and the pandas library. This involved removing duplicate and irrelevant data, converting data types, and creating new variables to facilitate analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

The cleaned dataset was then explored using various data visualization techniques. This included creating bar charts, line plots, heatmaps, and scatterplots to analyze trends and patterns in the data.

## Results and Conclusions

The analysis revealed several interesting insights about the history of LEGO sets. For example, it was found that Star Wars is the theme with the most LEGO sets, and that the number of parts per set has increased over time, indicating greater complexity and sophistication in LEGO design. Additionally, the analysis showed that LEGO expanded its product offering in the 1990s, with a significant increase in the number of themes and sets released each year.

Overall, this analysis provides a comprehensive overview of the history of LEGO sets and offers valuable insights for LEGO enthusiasts and fans. The code used for this analysis is included in this repository and can be used as a starting point for further exploration and analysis of LEGO data.
